#+TITLE: Item 10: Writing Exception-Safe Code - Part 3

- In each function, take all the code that might emit an exception and do all that work safely off to the side; only then, when you know that the real work has succeeded, should you modify the program state (and clean up) using only nonthrowing operations.
- A function with two different responsibilities is difficult to make exception-safe.
- A copy assignment operator that is written in such a way that it must check for self-assignment is probably not strongly exception-safe either.
