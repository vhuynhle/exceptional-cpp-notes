So you want a case-insensitive string class? Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write one.
#+end_quote

1. What does "case-insensitive" mean?
2. Write a =ci_string=  class that is identical to the standard =std::string= but that is case-insensitive in the same way as the commonly provided extension =stricmp()= . A =ci_string=  should be usable as follows:

#+begin_src cpp
  ci_string s( "AbCdE" );

  // case insensitive
  assert( s == "abcde" );
  assert( s == "ABCDE" );

  // still case-preserving, of course
  assert( strcmp( s.c_str(), "AbCdE" ) == 0 );
  assert( strcmp( s.c_str(), "abcde" ) != 0 );
#+end_src
3. Is making case sensitivity a property of the object a good idea?
