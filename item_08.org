#+TITLE: Item 8: Writing Exception-Safe Code - Part 1

- Exception safe :: Objects should always be in a correct and consistent state, regardless of any exceptions that may be thrown in the course of execution
- Exception neutral :: If an exception is thrown, it should be propagated through to the caller for him to handle it, because he knows the context of the exception and we don't.
